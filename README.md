# AssetXchange
### Project Description:
#### AssestXchange aims to simplify Asset management. AssetXchange enables users to tokenize their real-world assets easily through a non-technical Dapp </br> Rather than being limited to one type of asset for one sector, AssetXchange enables the creation of “Asset Types”​ </br> Businesses can then create “Asset Types” which represent a type of product or asset. “Assets” can then be created based on one of their asset types which represents a physical asset.​ <br/>These assets can be created and transferred to customers at the point of sale, or used internally for resource management​
### The problem: 
#### NFT representation of real-world assets is inaccessible for the majority of businesses:​ < br/> Has gained traction in industries like real estate and private equity but is not used in consumer industries​</br>Creating a decentralised platform for a specific sector restricts it a narrow market​<br/>Utilization of a highly technical platform in a sector dominated by small businesses is unlikely</br> 
### Key features built at ETH Oxford:
#### We used etherlink testnet to deploy our **ERC720** which has non-fungible tokens. </br> The main focus is on making blockchain and smart contracts deployed accessible to non-technical users, thereby expanding the Tezos ecosystem. Our dApp enables users to interact with smart contracts on Etherlink without deep coding knowledge. Smart contracts can be created depending on the asset types user wants (for clear representation visit the versel app). 
#### We created dApps that effectively tokenize real-world assets using the Etherlink rollup it solves a critical problem that it simplifies the  tokenization process, enhancing the reliability, security, and efficiency of linking on-chain and off-chain data.
